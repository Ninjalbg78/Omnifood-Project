### ::after and ::before:

These are pseudo-elements in CSS. They are used to create elements that are not present in the HTML markup but can be styled using CSS.

### ::before

creates a pseudo-element before the content of the selected element, and ::after creates one after the content.

### content: "";

: This line specifies the content that the pseudo-elements (::before and ::after) will contain. In this case, it's set to an empty string, which means these pseudo-elements won't display any content, but they will still be present on the page for styling purposes.

### display: block;

: This line sets the display property to "block" for the pseudo-elements, making them behave like block-level elements. Block-level elements take up the full width of their parent container and stack vertically.

### border-radius: 50%;

: This line creates a circular shape by setting the border-radius to 50%. This is because a border-radius of 50% on a square element will result in a circle.

### position: absolute;

: This line positions the pseudo-elements absolutely within their nearest positioned ancestor. Absolute positioning allows you to specify exact coordinates for the elements.

### top: 50%; and left: 50%;

: These lines position the center of the pseudo-elements at the center of their containing element (.step-img-box) by setting the top and left properties to 50%. This is a common technique for centering elements horizontally and vertically.

### transform: translate(-50%, -50%);

: This line applies a CSS transform to the pseudo-elements. The translate function is used to move the elements horizontally (-50%) and vertically (-50%) by half of their own width and height, effectively centering them within the .step-img-box.
