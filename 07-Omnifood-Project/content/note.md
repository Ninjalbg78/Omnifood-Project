--> NOTE: you might think you are multiplying *10 because you get the same answer, but you actually are NOT multipling. Its only a visual distortion. It appears that way because you are dealing with a base 10 number. If that WAS the case, then what about the size 16 font in the above example? You are not multiplying anything *16.. You divide and move the decimal to get a percentage.
