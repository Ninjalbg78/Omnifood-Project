## Using rem units in CSS instead of px (pixels) has several benefits, primarily related to accessibility, scalability, and consistency in web design:

### Scalability and Accessibility:

rem (root em) units are relative to the root (html or :root) font size. This means that when you set font-size using rem, it is relative to the user's preferred font size setting in their browser. This is beneficial for accessibility because it allows users to adjust the font size to their preference. If you use px, the text size won't scale with the user's settings, potentially making the content hard to read for some users.

### Consistency:

When using rem units, your entire CSS layout and typography system are based on the same root font size, typically set on the html or :root element. This ensures that all elements on your web page scale proportionally with respect to each other. In contrast, using px units can lead to inconsistencies, as each element's size is fixed in pixels and doesn't adapt to changes in font size or screen size.

### Ease of Maintenance:

By setting a root font size using rem, you can easily adjust the entire layout's scale by changing one value. This makes maintenance and updates more straightforward. With px, you'd need to manually adjust many pixel values across your CSS to achieve the same effect.

This code sets the font size for the html element to 62.5%. Here's what's happening:

## The default font size in most web browsers is typically 16px.

By setting font-size: 62.5%;, you are effectively setting the root font size to 62.5% of the default, which is 10px (62.5% of 16px). This is often done as a base font size for the entire document.

### The reason for setting the base font size to 10px is to make it easier to work with rem units throughout your CSS.

10px is a clean, round number that divides evenly by 2 (for 0.5rem), 4 (for 0.25rem), and other fractions, making it more convenient for designing responsive layouts.

### By using this base font size,

when you specify other sizes in rem units, they will be relative to this base size. For example, if you set an element's font size to 2rem, it will be 20px (2 times the base size of 10px).

### In summary,

setting the html element's font size to 62.5% is a common practice in web development to establish a consistent and easily scalable foundation for typography and layout using rem units. It improves accessibility, simplifies maintenance, and ensures that your design is responsive to users' font size preferences.
